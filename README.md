# Digital Art AI agents and ML training experiments


An experiments projects, with AI agents and ML training notebooks,
for the domain of digital art creation.
This is still project in the beginning, so many changes will likely happen.

## Project setup

To set up your environment variables, you need to duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. You can do this manually or using the following terminal command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env # Linux, macOS, Git Bash, WSL
copy .env.example .env # Windows Command Prompt
```

This command creates a copy of `.env.example` and names it `.env`, allowing you to configure your environment variables specific to your setup.

Currenlty the following environment variables are needed:




## Project Organization

The project structure was created from this template:  https://github.com/datalumina/datalumina-project-template.
Most of the folder are currently empty, the structure of the project may change.


Currently the following folders are of interest:
 - notebooks, contains some notebooks, . I personally created notebooks at google collab.



This is the original datalumina project structure
