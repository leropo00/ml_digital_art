# Digital Art ML notebooks and algorithms

Projects with notebooks for ML training, for the domain of digital art creation. 
Other notebooks about certain algorithms for image processing, tutorials of the used libraries 
or study of concepts related to ML will also be added here.

## Project Folder Organization

The project structure was created from this template: 
https://github.com/datalumina/datalumina-project-template.

Most directories are currently empty and might be removed in the future if they will not be used.

Currently, the following folders are of interest:

- notebooks: contains Jupyter Notebooks, which were tested via Google Colab.
  Warning: for some reason, GitHub can't render certain notebooks, but this does not mean that these notebooks don't work. 
  You just have to download the notebooks and open them elsewhere.

- notebooks_utils: contains helper functions for usage inside Notebooks.
  These functions are imported at the start of certain notebooks via Google Drive.
